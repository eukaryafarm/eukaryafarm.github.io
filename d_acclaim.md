    "It’s hard enough to find local mushrooms on a regular basis, when I found Tom, I found a
reliable, consistent supplier of some of the nicest mushrooms I’ve ever seen.  I am very happy
to have been working with Tom for 2 ½ years, and would highly recommend his farm to anyone
looking for a quality supply of locally grown mushrooms."

"Eukarya mushrooms are of the highest quality. Tom cultivates them in such a way to be packed with umami flavor and nutrition. The cooking applications are endless. I'm constantly discovering new ways to prepare them."
