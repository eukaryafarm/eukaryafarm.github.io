Eukarya organisms or eukaryotes are cells that contain their genetic material inside a nucleus. Eukaryotes in the beginning of their evolution split and created four different kingdoms which we categorized on Earth as Animals, Plants, Fungi, and Protista.  When Eukarya Farm was first established by Tom Bailey it was thought to one day encompass all four kingdoms and create a sustainable farm that could offer high quality produce from each category of life. Currently Eukarya Farm is focus on Fungi! Growing and producing multiple varieties for chefs/restaurants all across Colorado. In the future we will have more to offer, and will keep you up-to-date!
